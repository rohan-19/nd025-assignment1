## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The project uses two libraries outside the standard anaconda(python 3.x) distribution. Both of these can be installed using pip or conda.

1. pandas profiling (https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
2. seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, We are going to use the Airbnb Seattle data to better understand:

1. Which are the top neighbourhoods in Seattle for setting up an Airbnb?
2. Do user reviews drastically affect the success of your Airbnb?
3. Do bigger houses always fetch the maximum value? What other specifications can help you increase your listing price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project contains one jupyter notebook which performs basic EDA on the dataset and then uses visualizations and machine learning models to answer the questions we are interested in. 

Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rohan.kwatra19/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-airbnb-listing-seattle-edition-8938cb162851).
